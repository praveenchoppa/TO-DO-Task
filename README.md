# To-Do List App

A simple and clean To-Do List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- 📝 Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 🗂️ Tasks persist (optional: mention if you're using `localStorage`)

- Built as part of a learning journey by a tutorial for logic, but customized the UI and typed the code myself.
